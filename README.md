# Dapulse iOS Mobile Test

## Welcome

Hello dear candidate.

Use this project as a template for your test (optional but recommended).

This template covers some boilerplate you should have done anyway (networking and parsing the data into native models).

## 3rd party libs

In this project there are some 3rd parties in use:

* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - networking
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) - easy json parsing
* [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) - dependency injection

## CocoaPods

We use CocoaPods so dont forget to `pod install` after cloning the repo.

## Usage

See `AppDelegate.swift` file for how to use Swinject if you're not familiar with it.

See `ViewController.swift` file to see how to use `CompanyService` for getting the data to present.

## Questions

For any other questions, use Google, Stack Overflow or ask us :)

Good luck!
