# Dapulse iOS Mobile Test

Hello dear candidate.

Use this project as a template for your test (optional but recommended).

This template covers some boilerplate you should have done anyway (networking and parsing the data into native models).

In this project there are some 3rd parties in use:

* Alamofire - networking
* SwiftyJSON - easy json parsing
* Swinject - dependency injection

See `AppDelegate.swift` file for how to use Swinject if you're not familiar with it.

See `ViewController.swift` file to see how to use `CompanyService` for getting the data to present.

For any other questions, use Google, Stack Overflow or ask us :)

Good luck!
